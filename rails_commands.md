# One-To-Many Relationships
create migrations and models:
`rails generate migration [name of migrations] [first column:type] ...`
* default to `string` type if you don't specify column types
* make sure you include timestamps if you want them on the table

(`rails g migration` is shorthand for `rails generate migration`)

Remove a migration: `rails destroy migration [name of migrations]`

`rails g model [name of the model] [first column:type]`
to relate to the model to an existing model:
`rails g model ... [column]:references`
 * This creates the model and creates the migration for us
