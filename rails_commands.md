# Databse Commands
1. `rake db:create`
2. `rake db:migrate`
3. `rake db:seed`

Can combine commands such as: `rake db:{create,migrate,seed}` (must *not* have spaces inside the hash)

You (generally) don't need to run rake `db:test:prepare`; running `rake test` will load the schema to the test database

Rollback migration: `rake db:rollback`

# One-To-Many Relationships
create migrations and models:
`rails generate migration [name of migrations] [first column:type] ...`
* default to `string` type if you don't specify column types
* make sure you include timestamps if you want them on the table

(`rails g migration` is shorthand for `rails generate migration`)

Remove a migration: `rails destroy migration [name of migrations]`

`rails g model [name of the model] [first column:type]`
to relate to the model to an existing model:
`rails g model ... [table]:references`
 * This creates the model and creates the migration for us
